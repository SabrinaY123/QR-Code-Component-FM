## My process

- Set Up my GitHub and learned how pages work
- Studied the layout of the site (text boxes, alignment, positioning)
- Started with HTML base (added img, and text)
- Once I realized I could just use padding to keep the white background of the main container, I started going into CSS to style the elements
- Just kept toggling between the screenshot of the design image and my site
- created a new repository and added all my files for this project

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

When wanting to change font-weight it is much better linking different font-weights from your source (in this case Google Fonts) to give a wider range

This website helped alot![The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)


### Continued development

- Ugh the positioning was a pain until I realized this was a simple text-align; I definitely need to practice my positioning more
- Font Schemes: I know the font was given in the style guide but I struggled getting it to the exact look that came with the design preview
